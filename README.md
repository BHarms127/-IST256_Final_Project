# Feedback

## Usability Session 1

**Passenger Notes:** failed login/register hard to read

**Driver Notes:** no font awesome icon, card wasn't finished yet, only had Risk. Also, he cart has no limit so it can just keep going.

**Takeaways:** I plan to change the color of the failed attempt message,add a font awesome icon, and get the rest of the card working. lastly, setting a cart limit.

## Usability Session 2

**Passenger Notes:** Right side of the screen is rather empty (white space)

**Driver Notes:** the cart can be hard to follow as it goes across the entire screen, checkout button doesn't work 

**Takeaways:** I plan to change the page by moving the cart next to the card of games, by doing this the white spec issue is removed and the cart is less wide meaning it's easier to read.
